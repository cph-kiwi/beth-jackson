# Pulled chicken

<BlogTextWrapper>

I needed something to go in tacos, with the guacamole that Freyja asked for, and this was easy and great with barbeque sauce.

### Method

1. Rub the chicken breasts with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides.

2. Heat a little more oil in a pan and cook the chicken breasts for 6-7 minutes on each side.

3. Add the chicken stock, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is tender.

4. Shred the chicken using two forks. Return the chicken to the cooking liquid and add the barbeque sauce. Mix and heat through.

5. Serve with tortillas, guacamole, and salsa.
