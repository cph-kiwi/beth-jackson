# Mulled wine

<BlogTextWrapper>

I made this mulled wine for my brother's wedding. Every time I make it, I think of my brother and his charming wife. This is a Jamie Oliver recipe, but it's not in his Christmas recipe book. The only place I can find it is online. When I'm entertaining, I like to do as much ahead of time as possible, sometimes days ahead. I prefer to make the syrup for this beforehand, and then all I have to do on the day is pour the syrup into a pot, with the wine, and heat through until it is drinking temperature (not too hot, because you will burn off the alcohol).

I tend to save some of the peel and whole spices to use as garnish, especially if I am making this as a Christmas gift for friends. The bottle looks pretty with star anise, a cinnamon stick and a slice of citrus peel in. This makes enough syrup for two bottles of wine, and unless I'm having a party, that's a lot of wine to get through! So I make a double batch, and then divide into four small bottles so that I can use one per bottle of wine (hope that makes sense!).

### Method

1. Peel large sections of peel from the oranges, lemon and lime using a potato-peeler.

2. Put the sugar in a large saucepan over a medium heat, add the pieces of peel and squeeze in the orange juice.

3. Add the cloves, cinnamon stick, star anise, bay leaves and about 10 to 12 gratings of nutmeg. Halve the vanilla pod lengthways and add to the pan, then stir in just enough sherry or brandy to cover the sugar.

4. Let this simmer until the sugar has completely dissolved into the liquid, then bring to the boil. Keep on a rolling boil for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until the syrup is thick.

5. If you are not serving immediately, when the syrup is ready leave it to cool a little. Strain it and pour it into the storage container. Save some of the rough stuff as a garnish, and add to the storage container. When ready to use, pour into a pot, and follow step 6.

6. If serving immediately, when the syrup is ready, turn the heat down to low and add the wine. Gently heat the wine for around 5 minutes, and serve when it is warm enough.
