# Sweet salty crunchy nut bars

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is a recipe from Nigella Lawson, in her book Kitchen. The original recipe calls for Crunchy Bars, but I can't get them in Denmark. Instead I use Malteasers, and it works out just fine. The original recipe also called for 200g dark chocolate and 100g milk chocolate, but I prefer to use dark milk chocolate (around 50% cocoa solids). I can't get golden syrup in Denmark, so I use lys sirup. The flavour is not the same, but it's a fair substitute.

### Ingredients

- 300g dark milk chocolate
- 125g butter
- 3 x 15ml tblsps lys sirup (golden syrup if you can get it)
- 250g salted peanuts
- 160g Malteasers

### Method

1. Line a tin with greaseproof paper.

2. Put the chocolate (broken up), butter, and syrup in a saucepan and melt together gently and slowly. Once all incorporated, dump in the peanuts and Malteasers. Stir quickly and breifly so that everything is mixed through, but the chocolate on the Malteasers hasn't melted too much.

3. Tip it all into the lined tin and spread until flattened on top. Place in the fridge for at least four hours, then cut into small squares. Store in the fridge.
