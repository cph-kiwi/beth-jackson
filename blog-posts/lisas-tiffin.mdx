# Lisa's tiffin

This is a recipe from my bestie Lisa Jeffares. I can see from the email chain, that she got it from her friend Vic, who got it from Louise - it's one of those recipes that everyone wants once they try it. You can use any dried fruit you like. If you prefer dark chocolate, that works too.

### Ingredients

- 100g butter
- 25g soft brown sugar
- 3 tblsp cocoa
- 4 tblsp golden syrup (lys sirup in Denmark)
- 225g crushed digestive biscuits
- 50g raisins
- 50g dried cranberries
- 50g dried apricots
- 15g butter
- 225g dark milk chocolate

### Method

1. Line a tin with greaseproof paper.

2. Place the butter, sugar, cocoa, and golden syrup in a saucepan over a medium heat, and melt gently to combine.

3. Add the crushed digestive biscuits and dried fruit tot he saucepan, and mix well.

4. Press mixture into the lined tin.

5. Place the chocolate and 15g butter in a saucepan and melt together gently over a medium heat. Pour this over the biscuit mixture in the tin, and smooth the top.

6. Chill in the fridge overnight before cutting.
