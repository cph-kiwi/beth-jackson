# Breakfast flapjacks

<BlogTextWrapper>

These are an extension of the plain flapjack recipe. My children don't like these, but I think these are more interesting to an adult palate. I swap out pistachios for almonds, as I'm not keen on pistachios.

### Ingredients

- 75g golden syrup
- 125g butter
- 100g sugar
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 175g grated apple
- 75g dates, roughly chopped
- 75g dried cranberries
- 50g slivered almonds
- 200g porridge oats
- 75g desiccated coconut

### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 150 degrees Celsius fan forced. Cut some baking paper to fit up the sides of the tin. Crumble the paper into a ball, and then flatten it out again. Place it in the tin, ready for the mixture.

2. Heat the syrup, butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a large saucepan, and heat on medium for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until completely melted.

3. Add the apple, and dates. Stir on a meduim heat for 3-4 minutes. Then add the cranberries, almonds, porridge oats and deciccated coconut. Stir until completely combined.

4. Tip the mixture into a lined baking tin and press well. Bake for 40 minutes, until golden brown on top.

5. Leave them to cool completely in the tin. Do not touch them! Then pull them out by the paper and cut into bars. Store in an airtight container.
