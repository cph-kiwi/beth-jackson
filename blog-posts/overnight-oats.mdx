# Overnight oats

This recipe is from Tom Kerridge by way of BBC Food. I have modified the quantities to suit my taste and for convenience. I found his recipe to be too sweet.

### Ingredients

- 480g tin of peaches
- 30g oats
- 50ml peach liquid
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 50ml milk
- 50g yoghurt
- handful of frozen raspberries
- flaked almonds
- honey

1. Pour the liquid from the peaches into an airtight container. Drain the peaches in a seive. Place the peaches in a separate airtight container and store in the fridge.

2. Place the oats, 50ml of the peach liquid, cinnamon, milk, and yoghurt in a separate airtight container. Stir until well combined.

3. Place the raspberries on top of the oats, and strew on the lid. Place in the fridge overnight.

4. In the morning, pour the oats into a bowl. Cut up 1 1/2 peaches and add them to the bowl. Stir them through. Sprinkle some almond flakes over the top and add a squirt of honey.

The peaches usually run out before I run out of peach liquid. There's enough for around 5 breakfasts. Once the peaches have been uncanned for 7 days, I would throw them away and start on a new tin. But it's easy to tell when they've turned. The peaches and the liquid start to smell a little funky.
