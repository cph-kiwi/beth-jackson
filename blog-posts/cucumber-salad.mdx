# Cucumber salad

<BlogTextWrapper>

The first time I ate this was at my friend Lisa's house. I couldn't stop thinking about it afterward. It's from one of those Jamie Oliver books where you're supposed to make the whole meal, with dessert and everything included in the one recipe. That doesn't work for me, so I picked out just this salad. I've also changed it a little bit to suit our taste. This salad takes only a couple of minutes to put together. However, it has to be served straight away. It will not keep for any length of time, not even in the fridge.

### Method

1. Place the ginger in a bowl, and add the soy sauce, olive oil, and sesame oil.

2. Squeeze the juice from the lime and add to the bowl. Check if it needs salt.

3. Use a speed-peeler to peel the cucumber from top to bottom so that the flesh comes away in ribbons. Add them to the bowl. Stop peeling when you get to the seedy, watery core, and throw the core away.

4. Gently move the cucumber around to that it is all coated in the dressing. Finely chop the coriander and sprinkle over the top.

Serve and eat immediately!
