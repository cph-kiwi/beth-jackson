# Porridge

I know it seems silly to call this a recipe and write it down, but from one winter to the next, I can't remember the proportions. This is the quantity for one adult, or two child-sized portions. I make this in the evening, and put in airtight jars in the fridge to be quickly reheated in the morning with a splash of water.

### Ingredients

- 40g porridge oats
- 300ml milk
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp vanilla paste
- 1/2 an apple or pear, peeled and chopped (if you can get away with it)
- Top with honey, butter, jam, fruit pur√©e or banana

1. Place the oats, milk, salt, cinnamon, vanilla, and apple or pear in a small saucepan. On a medium heat, bring to a simmer stirring constantly.

2. Stir constantly for 5 minutes while it simmers.

3. If eating straight away, pour into a bowl and add toppings of your choice. If making ahead, halve into little containers and store in the fridge.
