# Oaty apple loaf

<BlogTextWrapper>

My daughter and mother-in-law went apple-picking and came home with quite a pile. So I've been using every apple recipe I know to try and get through them. This loaf cake is quick and easy. It would work well to take to a picnic.

### Method

1. Line a 22cm loaf tin with paper.

2. Put butter, mixed spice, cinnamon, brown sugar, apples, sultanas, and water into a large sauce-pan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

3. Preheat oven to 180°C fan-forced. Add baking soda to the sauce-pan, then beat in eggs and rolled oats. Sift flour and baking powder into the sauce-pan. Stir to combine.

4. Pour mixture into the loaf tin. Bake for 45 minutes. Leave in the tin for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.
