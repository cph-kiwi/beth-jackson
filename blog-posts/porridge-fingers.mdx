# Porridge fingers

<BlogTextWrapper>

We have done baby-led weaning with both babies. Porridge fingers are a super convenient breakfast for babies because they can feed themselves, pick them up easily and so on, allowing grownups to do other things while the baby eats. I also find these to be a convenient way of adding veg into my baby's diet by using purées. A massive area of concern is introducing babies to potential allergens as early as possible to avoid allergies. My understanding is that this should be done as early as possible. Using these porridge fingers, I was able to give them exposure to nuts super early and it's an easy way of doing it.

### Ingredients

- 80g fine-ground porridge oats
- 300ml total liquid

This could be a combination of the following:

- Vegetable or fruit purée or mash
- 1 tblsp nut butter of your choice (peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, hazelnut butter)
- Top up to 300ml with whole milk or formula

### Method

1. Line a small shallow dish with tin foil.

2. Add oats to a small saucepan. Add the liquids of choice.

3. Bring to a boil, turn down heat, and cook for 5 minutes stirring all the time. This is important because it is very thick and sticks to the bottom of the pot very easily.

4. Pour the porridge into the lined dish and leave to cool completely. I leave this overnight and continue to the next step in the morning.

5. Flip the dish onto a cutting board. Slice the porridge into finger-sized pieces. I place these on greaseproof paper and freeze them.

6. Each evening I take out 4 to 5 pieces and put them in the fridge. In the morning I heat up a pan and melt some unsalted butter. Then I fry the porridge fingers until they are a little bit browned and heated through. The frying helps them hold together so that the baby can hold them a bit easier. Obviously wait until they've cooled down a bit before giving them to the baby!
