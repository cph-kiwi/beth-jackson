# Banana bread

I wouldn't be a millennial who has just gone through two lockdowns due to a pandemic without having a banana bread recipe. However, I have had this recipe for many years and made it fairly regularly before the pandemic happened. This is in no way "bread" and is, in fact, a cake.

### Ingredients

- 75g butter
- 300g plain white flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 135g sugar
- 2 eggs
- 60ml milk
- 1 tsp vanilla paste
- 4 bananas roughly mashed
- 200g small chocolate buttons

### Method

1. Grease a 22cm loaf tin with butter.

2. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat.

3. Preheat oven to 180Â°C fan.

4. In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Add the salt and sugar, and stir well.

5. In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, vanilla paste and mashed banana. Mix together well.

6. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and add the chocolate buttons. Stir until just combined.

7. Pour into the greased tin and bake for 45 - 55 minutes. Leave in the tin for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.
