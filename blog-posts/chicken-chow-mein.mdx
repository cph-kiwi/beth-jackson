# Chicken chow mein

<BlogTextWrapper>

I'm crazy about Five Spice, and I love sprouts and sugarsnap peas. I'm not so keen on red peppers, but I make this on purpose to show my daughter that you can still eat a thing, even if you claim to not like it (it doesn't work).

### Ingredients

- 150g medium egg noodles
- dash sesame oil
- 300g skinless chicken breast fillets, sliced into thin strips
- 2 tblsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp five-spice powder
- 1 tsp chilli sauce (optional, I serve with dried chili flakes to sprinkle over at the table)
- 1 tblsp cornflour
- 1 tblsp groundnut oil
- 1 red pepper, seeds removed and thinly sliced
- 150g bean sprouts
- 125g sugarsnap peas
- 1 spring onion, sliced thinly
- freshly ground black pepper

### Method

1. Cook the noodles in a pan of boiling water for 2–3 minutes, until al dente, or according to packet instructions. Drain, then rinse under cold running water and drain again. Drizzle with a dash of sesame oil and toss through to prevent the noodles from sticking to each other.

2. Put the chicken strips in a bowl and season with a dash of light soy sauce, the five-spice powder and chilli sauce, if using. Mix well, then lightly dust the chicken strips with the cornflour.

3. Heat a wok until smoking and add the oil, then add the chicken and stir fry for 3–4 minutes, or until the chicken is golden-brown and cooked through.

4. Add the red pepper and stir fry for 1 minute, then add the bean sprouts, sugarsnaps and spring onion and stir fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the cooked noodles and season with the soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil and freshly ground black pepper.

5. Pile the noodles onto a serving plate and serve immediately.
