# Pasta e patate

<BlogTextWrapper>

I'm still working this one out, but I don't want to lose the piece of paper I've been scribbling on. I saw this on TikTok, but annoyingly it was more of a suggestion than an actual recipe. I have this amazing and encyclopedic italian cookbook, and this recipe wasn't in there, which makes me suspicious. But the idea is a good one.

### Method

1. Cook the pancetta or guancele on a medium to low heat until cooked.

2. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Cover and cook for 10 minutes.

3. Add the tomato paste, rosmary salt, tomato, potato, and 500ml water. Bring to a boil, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Mash the potatoes a bit, but leave some in bigger chucnks.

4. Add the pasta and 500ml water. Cook on medium heat until the pasta is cooked (around 15 minutes).

5. Take off the heat and add a big handful of grated parmesan. Cover for 2-3 minutes.

6. To serve, plate up and then drizzle on some good olive oil, sprinkle on some more grated parmesan and the chopped celery leaves.
