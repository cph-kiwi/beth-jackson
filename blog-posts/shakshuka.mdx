# Shakshuka

<BlogTextWrapper>

I ate this for the first time at a Jaffa beach-side cafe in Tel Aviv. It was so tasty and I couldn't stop thinking about it when I got home. Turns out there are loads of recipes online. Shakshuka is the Bolognese of eggs. Everyone has their own recipe. I tried to make mine like the one I had in Tel Aviv, but it is also very easy and simple. When I ate this is Tel Aviv, in came in a little individual ceramic dish, straight from the oven, but I find it easier to make everyone's together in a large pan and then serve it up onto toast.

### Method

1. Heat the oil and butter in a wide lidded pan over a medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic until soft but not coloured.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={10} inputSeconds={0} />

2. Add the tinned tomatoes, a splash of water (about 100 ml), harissa, cumin, and caraway seeds. Reduce for around 15 minutes.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={15} inputSeconds={0} />

3. While that is cooking, prepare the toast.

4. Add the tomato purée and cook for another 5 minutes, taste and add salt and pepper to your liking.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={5} inputSeconds={0} />

5. Make wells around the sides of the pan and add the eggs. Sprinkle a little salt directly onto the eggs. Cover with the lid and cook for around 5 minutes.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={5} inputSeconds={0} />

6. Lift some of the sauce out and spread on the toast. Then place the eggs on top.

I like the yolks a little bit cooked, but still runny at the very centre. So adjust the cooking time of the eggs to suit you.
