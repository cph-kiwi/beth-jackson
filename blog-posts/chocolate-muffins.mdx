It's the school holidays. I'm desperate to keep the children fed. These were a hit.

### Ingredients

- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar
- 170g sugar
- 125g butter
- 140g dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 100ml milk
- 100ml 18% fat creme fraiche
- 50g dark choclate, roughly chopped
- 165g flour
- 10g cocoa powder
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Method

1. Beat eggs, vanilla sugar and sugar until light and fluffy.

2. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat and then immediately remove from heat. Add the finely chopped chocolate to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate is melted.

3. Add the chocolate and butter mixture to the bowl with the eggs and sugar and whisk together. Then add the milk and crème fraîche and stir together.

4. Mix together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt, sift into the batter. Add the roughly chopped chocolate and stir well.

5. Divide the batter into 12 muffin tins. Bake in a preheated oven at 170 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, until the centre is set.

6. Leave to cool on a wire rack.
