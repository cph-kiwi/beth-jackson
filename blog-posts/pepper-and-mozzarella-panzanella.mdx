# Pepper and mozzarella panzanella

I discovered this at the start of the 2021 summer, and I can't stop thinking about it. It's very tasty, and I can make it throughout the day, a little time here, a little time there, which is my preferred way to cook in the summer.

### Ingredients

- 4 thick slices of bread
- 3 large red bell peppers, halved with seeds removed
- 1 red onion, cut into 8 wedges
- 3 tblsp olive oil
- salt and pepper
- 1 ball mozzarella, cut into cubes
- fresh basil, chopped

#### Dressing

- 2 tblsp sherry vinegar (or red wine vinegar)
- 1 tblsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tblsp capers, drained (rinsed if salted)

### Method

1. Place a griddle pan on a high heat. While that is getting up to temperature, put the peppers in a bowl and pour a little olive oil over. Mix around until they're covered. Cook on the griddle pan until the skin is charred. Place in a clean bowl and cover with tin foil to trap the heat. Turn griddle pan off.

2. Once the peppers are cool enough to handle, remove as much of the skin as you can. Cut peppers into strips.

3. In a large clean bowl, whisk together the vinegar, one tablespoon olive oil, sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, and minced garlic. Add the capers and peppers to the bowl, and let them marinade, the longer the better.

4. After the peppers have marinaded as long as possible, heat up the griddle pan again. Put the onions in the same bowl you used when coating the peppers with oil. Pour a little olive oil over and mix around until well coated. Add the onions to the griddle pan and spread out. Remove from the pan once cooked to your liking (looking a little charred in places). Set aside.

5. Use the bread to mop up the oil in the bowl and/or spread a little olive oil on both sides of the bread. Toast the bread on the griddle pan. Cut the toast into cubes, and set aside with the onions.

6. Add the onions, toast, mozzarella, and basil to the bowl with the peppers. Mix everything gently to make sure it's all coated in the marinade.
