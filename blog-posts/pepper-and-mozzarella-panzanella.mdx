# Pepper and mozzarella panzanella

<BlogTextWrapper>

I discovered this at the start of the 2021 summer, and I can't stop thinking about it. It's very tasty, and I can make it throughout the day, a little time here, a little time there, which is my preferred way to cook in the summer. I can't be arsed with char-grilling pepppers myself - I can never get the skins off properly and it puts me in a bad mood. So now I just buy jarred char-grilled peppers.

### Ingredients

- 400g can butter beans

#### Dressing

- 2 tblsp sherry vinegar (or red wine vinegar)

### Method

1. Drain the peppers for as long as possible, then cut into strips. Drain the butter beans.

2. In a large clean bowl, whisk together the vinegar, one tablespoon olive oil, sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, and minced garlic. Add the capers, peppers and butter beans to the bowl, and let them marinade, the longer the better.

3. After the peppers have marinaded as long as possible, heat up a griddle pan. Put the onions in a bowl and coat with oil. Add the onions to the griddle pan and spread out. Remove from the pan once cooked to your liking (looking a little charred in places). Set aside.

4. Use the bread to mop up the oil in the bowl and/or spread a little olive oil on both sides of the bread. Toast the bread on the griddle pan or under the grill of the oven. Cut the toast into cubes, and set aside with the onions.

5. Add the onions, toast, mozzarella, and basil to the bowl with the peppers. Mix everything gently to make sure it's all coated in the marinade.
