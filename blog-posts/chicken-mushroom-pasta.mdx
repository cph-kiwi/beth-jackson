### Method

1. Place a griddle pan on a medium high heat. While that is getting up to temperature, slice the chicken breasts in half, filleting them so that you have four flat, thin breasts. Spatter olive oil on all sides and lay them out flat. Sprinkle the salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried thyme over both sides. Lay them on the griddle pan and cook for around three minutes on each side or until just cooked though. Place the chicken to one side on a plate to cool down.

2. Melt the butter in a tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium high heat. Add the mushrooms. Don't stir them very often, just let them sit so that they get a little brown. After around eight minutes, add the onion and turn the heat down to medium. Cook until the onion is clear.

3. While the mushrooms and onions are cooking, get another pan full of water on the stovetop and bring to a boil.

4. Add the garlic to the veg pan and cook for one minute. Pour in the wine and let it reduce until nearly all gone.

5. Pour in the chicken stock, cream and one teaspoon of salt. Cook for 10 minutes.

6. While the sauce is cooking, cook the pasta. Drain once it is finished.

7. Slice the chicken across the grain, into strips.

8. Add the pasta, chicken, parmesan and parsley to the pan, and give it all a good stir.

Serve with garlic bread and a side salad.
