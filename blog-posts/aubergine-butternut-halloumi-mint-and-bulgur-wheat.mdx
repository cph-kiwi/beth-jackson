# Aubergine butternut halloumi mint and bulgur wheat

This recipe is from Rukmini Iyer's The Roasting Tin. It's one of my favourite home dinners. This can be eaten hot or cold, and packs away well for eating while out and about.

### Ingredients

- 700g butternut, skinned, deseeded, and chopped into 1.5cm cubes
- 1 large aubergine, cut into 1cm cubes
- 250g halloumi, cut into 1cm cubes
- 3 tblsp olive oil
- a bunch of fresh mint, chopped
- salt and pepper
- 200g bulgur wheat
- 400ml vegetable stock

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C fan. Place the butternut, aubergine, halloumi, olive oil, mint, and salt and pepper in a large roasting dish. Roast for 45 minutes.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={45} inputSeconds={0} />

2. Add the bulgur wheat to the tin and stir it to coat it in the liquid. Add the stock and mix again. Cover tightly with tin foil, and return to the oven for 15 minutes.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={15} inputSeconds={0} />

3. Remove from the oven and let it sit for 5 minutes with the foil still covering the tin.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={5} inputSeconds={0} />
