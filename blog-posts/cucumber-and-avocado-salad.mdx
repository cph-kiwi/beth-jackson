# Cucumber and avocado salad

<BlogTextWrapper>

I love taking this salad to a barbeque because it will be unlike any other salad there. The best thing about this salad is the crunch of the cucumber. Don't be shy with the Sriracha.

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cucumbers
- 1 spring onion, thinly sliced
- 1 large avocado, pitted and diced
- 2 tblsp mayonaise or yoghurt (I prefer yoghurt)
- Juice of half a lime
- 1 tsp Sriracha
- 1/4 tsp salt
- chopped coriander

### Method

1. Cut the cucumbers in half and remove the seeds with a spoon. Chop them roughly into 1cm dice.

2. Place the cucumbers, spring onion and avocado in a bowl.

3. In a small bowl, combine the mayonaise or yoghurt, lime juice, Sriracha, salt and coriander.

4. Fold the dressing through the cucumbers and avocado, being careful not to break up the avocado too much.
