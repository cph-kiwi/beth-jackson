# Hot chocolate

<BlogTextWrapper>

I like to make hot chocolate on cold days, for the family. I think it tastes best when made from chocolate rather than cocoa. This serves two adults and one child, so you might need to double it. I use dark milk chocolate, but this is down to your taste.

### Method

1. Heat the milk gently in a saucepan with the spices, until almost boiling.

2. Stir in the chocolate and whisk vigorously for a couple of minutes.

3. Strain into a jug, then pour into cups for serving. I add a little cold milk to my kid's drink, to cool it down, and so that it is not quite so intense for her.
