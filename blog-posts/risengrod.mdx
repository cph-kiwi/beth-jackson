# Risengrød

This is my mother-in-law's recipe. It serves three hungry people. This is traditionally eaten for breakfast on Christmas Eve in Denmark. The idea is that you make loads, and everyone fills up on the cheap stuff before the Christmas feast in the evening. The leftovers are also used to make a traditional Danish Christmas dessert, risalamande. When making this at Christmas, I double it. Actually, my measurements below are 1.5 x what my mother-in-law uses.

### Ingredients

- 187g shortgrain rice (grødris)
- 150ml boiling water
- 1.5l full-fat milk (sød mælk)
- 1/2 tsp table salt (not sea salt)
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 4 tsp sugar

1. Put the rice in a large saucepan. Pour the water over it and turn the heat to medium high. Stir constantly until the water is absorbed.

2. Pour the milk in. Turn the temperature down to medium. Stir constantly. It should simmer gently, so adjust the temperature as required. After 40 minutes I check to see if the rice is cooked by taste-test. Keep cooking until rice is done and the grød is the consistency you want (porridge like, but not too firm). Mix in the salt.

3. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon.

4. When serving, place grød in a bowl. Add a small knob of butter (don't skimp), and sprinkle the sugar mixture over the top.
