# White asparagus

<BlogTextWrapper>

I was walking around the supermarket, and I saw these bunches of huge white asparagus. I wanted to buy them but I didn't know what to do with them. I hadn't seen these in New Zealand, and have only seen them since moving to Europe. I bought some and found this recipe when I got home. Now, when it's asparagus season, I have these quite often for lunch. This makes enough for two people, and I serve it with garlic bread.

### Method

1. Set a saucepan on the stove top, fill with water and bring to the boil. Add salt.

2. Snap the woody ends off the asparagus and peel the broken end with a potato peeler. Place in the boiling water and cook for 12-15 minutes until the stems are tender. Drain into a colander.

3. Place the lemon juice, mustard, and honey in a bowl with some salt and pepper. Whisk together, then whisk in the oil, and finally stir in the chives.

4. Divide the asparagus between two plates. Arrange two pieces of ham on top of each pile. Then drizzle the dressing over the top.
