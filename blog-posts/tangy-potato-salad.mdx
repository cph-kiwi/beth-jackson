# Tangy potato salad with celery and mustard

<BlogTextWrapper>

This was the recipe of the summer for me. After I made it the first time, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and wanted to eat it at every opportunity. This is a recipe from Alison Roman's newsletter. It can also be found on YouTube. This seems like a lot of mustard, and it is a strongly flavoured salad. But it works! Trust the recipe. Alison leaves the skin on the lemon, and I like it that way myself. However, it's "too bitter" for the husband, so I leave it out.

### Method

1. Cut the potatoes in half. Boil them in salted water for 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain them, then set them aside to cool completely.

2. Place the lemon, spring onions, celery, vinegar and mustard in a large bowl. Mix together well and season with salt and pepper.

3. Crush the potatoes so that they are flattened, then add them to the bowl.

4. Add olive oil to the bowl and mix everything together again, breaking up the potatoes as you mix. Taste and adjust the salt level if need be.

5. Add celery leaves and dill just before serving.
