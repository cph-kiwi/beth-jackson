# Jerusalem artichoke soup

<BlogTextWrapper>

I ate this for the first time as a starter at a sweet little neighbourhood restaurant in North Western Copenhagen. A friend took me there to eat, and I've never been able to find it again. It was the kind of place that made modern non-fussy seasonal Scandanavian food. I had to learn how to recreate this soup as I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now, if Jerusalem artichokes are on a menu, I'm choosing them! They are an absolute pain to peel - I don't know why, but it always takes me so long to get through them when preparing them. So allow extra prep time. The good news is that this soup freezes well. I read a few recipes and settled on this hybrid, so no references are provided. It's much better without creme fraiche, so skip over that when serving.

### Method

1. Peel the jerusalem artichokes. Cut them into thirds, place them in cold water to soak until needed. Set aside.

2. Add the olive oil to a saucepan, over a medium heat, and soften the onion, carrot, and celery for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the stock, drained jerusalem artichokes and celeriac. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 35 minutes.

3. Add the salt. Using a stick blender, blend until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning if required. Sprinkle the coriander over just before serving.
