# Æblegrød pandekager

<BlogTextWrapper>

Picking apples is a national passtime in Denmark, starting in late August. There are parks with apple trees where the public are welcome to pick the apples. People share them with friends and family. So it's not uncommon to be handed a giant bag of apples. We find it difficult to get through so many before they start rotting, and often they have worms, so making them into [æblegrød (stewed apples or apple sauce)](https://cph.kiwi/blog/æblegrød) is a good way to use them up and remove the worms before eating. I make a big batch and then freeze it in 1 cup measures. If I plan to make these pancakes in the morning, I just take a bag out of the freezer the night before to defrost. Otherwise, this is a fairly straightforward pancake recipe.

### Method

1. Place all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk together until smooth.

2. Place a heatproof plate in the oven with some absorbant kitchen paper and preheat to 50°C.

3. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add a little oil and butter to the pan before each pancake.

4. Pour a small amount of batter into the pan and cook until bubbles form on the surface. Flip and cook for a further 1-2 minutes.

5. Once the pancake is cooked place it on the plate in the oven to keep warm while you cook the rest of the pancakes.

6. Serve with your favourite toppings, but I recommend maple syrup.
