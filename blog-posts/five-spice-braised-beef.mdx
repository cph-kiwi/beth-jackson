# Five-spice braised beef

This recipe is from Justine Pattison on BBC Food.

### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp rapeseed oil
- 2 large red onions, thinly sliced
- 50g fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 500g braising steak, trimmed, cut into 5cm cubes
- 2 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
- 350ml hot beef stock
- 4 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 4 tsp cornflour
- 2 tbsp clear honey
- pepper

### Method

1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for 8-10 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened and lightly browned. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli flakes, stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn't burn.

2. Season the beef all over with pepper, then sprinkle over the five-spice powder and mix to coat evenly. Add to the pan and fry for 3-4 minutes, turning the beef regularly until lightly browned all over.

4. When the beef is cooked, whisk the cornflour with 1 tablespoon of the hot stock liquid from the slow-cooker, to a smooth paste, stir in the honey. Add to the slow-cooker, cover and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the sauce is glossy and has thickened slightly.
