# Risotto

<BlogTextWrapper>

Surprisingly, I've found it difficult to find a simple recipe for risotto - a generic standard recipe. So after reading many many recipes, this is now my way of doing it.

### Ingredients

- 500g asparagus, trimmed and chopped into 2 - 3 cm pieces
- 150g mushrooms, chopped
- 4 tblsp olive oil
- 85g butter
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 350g arborio rice
- 170ml white wine
- 1 litre vegetable stock
- 60g parmesan, grated
- salt and pepper

### Method

1. Heat the stock in a saucepan.

2. Cook the asparagus in a pan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain, cool under running cold water, then set aside, reserving the hot cooking water.

3. In a pan over a medium heat, add 2 tblsp olive oil and a bit of the butter. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.

4. Add 2 tblsp more olive oil and a bit more of the butter to the pan and add the onion. Cook until soft.

5. Stir in the rice and allow it to be coated in the oil and butter. Add the wine, and allow it to be absorbed completely.

6. Add the stock one ladleful at a time, stirring until all of the stock is absorbed before adding another ladleful.

7. When nearly all of the stock has been used, bite a grain of rice between your teeth to check if it is cooked through. If you use up all of the stock start adding the asparagus cooking water. Make sure to stop just before the rice is completely cooked, because it continues to cook as it cools down. Take it off the heat.

8. Add the rest of the butter and the parmesan. Stir well. Add the asparagus and mushrooms back in.
