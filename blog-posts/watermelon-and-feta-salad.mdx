# Watermelon and feta salad

<BlogTextWrapper>

My friend Anna makes this when she hosts barbeques. It's delicious and refreshing. You can customise this in a lot of ways that I will try to illustrate below.

### Ingredients

- 1/2 watermelon
- 1 tblsp olive oil
- juice of 1/2 a lime
- salt and pepper
- chopped leaves of two sprigs of mint
- 200g feta

#### Optional extras

- 1/2 a red onion, chopped, or 1 spring onion
- 1/2 a cucumber

### Method

1. Chop the watermelon into chucks, and remove the peel. Place in a large bowl.

2. Pour the oil and lime juice over the watermelon. Scatter the mint leaves, salt and pepper over the top and stir through a little.

3. Chop the feta into 1cm cubes and scatter over the top. Stir gently to avoid mashing the feta. Serve immediately.

This salad doesn't keep well, so make it right before serving.
