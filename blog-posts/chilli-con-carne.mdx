# Chilli con Carne

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is a winner with the children. I like that I can do a big batch and freeze it. I usually serve with rice, but it also works with crusty bread, over a jacket potato or with couscous.

### Ingredients

- 2 onions
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 2 carrots
- 2 sticks of celery
- 2 red peppers
- olive oil
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- salt and pepper
- 1 x 400g tin chickpeas
- 1 x 400g tin red kidney beans
- 2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
- 500g minced beef
- 1 bunch coriander
- 2 tblsp balsamic vinegar
- 50g dark chocolate
- 400g basmati rice
- 1 x 500g natural yoghurt
- 1 lime
- bag of tortilla chips

### Method

1. Chop the onions, garlic, carrots, celery, red peppers, and coriander stalks.

2. Place a large pan on a medium high heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a knob of butter. Add all the chopped veg, chilli powder, cumin, and cinnamon, salt and pepper. Cook stirring regularly for around 7 to 10 minutes.

3. Drain the chickpeas and kidney beans, and add them to the pan, as well as the tinned tomatoes.

4. Add the minced beef, breaking it up with the spoon. Fill one of the empty tins with water and add to the pan.

5. Add the balsamic vinegar and stir well. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for an hour, stirring every now and then to stop it from catching on the bottom. Stir in the chocolate.

6. Serve with rice, coriander leaves, yoghurt, lime, and tortilla chips.
