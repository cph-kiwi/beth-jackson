# Pasta in tomato sauce

<BlogTextWrapper>

Another one of those recipes that are not really recipes and everyone has their own version. I make this when I have nothing in the fridge, I haven't planned anything, and it's half an hour until dinner time. I always have the ingredients for this at home. If you have the time, toasted pine nuts make a great addition, scattered over the top before serving.

### Ingredients

- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 1 tblsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tblsp tomato paste

- 1 tin crushed tomatoes
- parmesan
- basil
- 400g pasta (I use penne)

### Method

1. Get the pasta water on the heat and bring to a boil.

2. Put a saucepan on the heat, and add the oil.

3. Cook the oil gently for around 8 minutes, until it is soft but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook for only a minute. Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more.

4. Put the pasta on to cook. When you drain it, be sure to save around a tin of water.

5. Add the tomatoes, honey and salt to the onions. Add 1/2 a tin of the pasta water, and cook for 10 minutes with a lid on. Stir regularly.

6. Using a stick blender, blend the sauce until smooth. Add the cheese, basil and pasta to the sauce. If the sauce needs loosening up, splash in the water until it is a silky consistency.
