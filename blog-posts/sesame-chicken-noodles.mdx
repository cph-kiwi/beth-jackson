# Sesame chicken noodles

<BlogTextWrapper>

I had a hankering for something like this last summer, and it has become a regular favourite. The website calls it a salad... I mean, sure. It could be a salad. I adapted it to be a bit more a main by adding chicken.

### Ingredients

- 2 tblsp rice vinegar

- 1 tblsp sesame oil
- 1 tblsp lime juice
- 1 tblsp minced ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed

#### NOODLE SALAD

- 2 chicken breasts

### Method

1. Whisk together all the sesame dressing ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.

2. Place a griddle pan on a medium high heat. While that is getting up to temperature, slice the chicken breasts in half, filleting them so that you have four flat, thin breasts. Spatter olive oil on all sides and lay them out flat. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over both sides. Lay them on the griddle pan and cook for around three minutes on each side or until just cooked though. Place the chicken to one side on a plate to cool down.

3. Cook noodles according to package instructions then rinse in cold water to cool them quickly and stop them from sticking together. Set aside to drain.

4. Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise, then remove the seedy middle with a spoon. Cut into matchsticks. Slice the chicken into strips.

5. Combine the noodles and the dressing. Mix well to coat every noodle.

6. To serve, place some noodles in a shallow wide pasta bowl. Place some chicken strips and cucumber matchsticks on top. Scatter over some spring onions, coriander and peanuts. Place a lime wedge on the side.
