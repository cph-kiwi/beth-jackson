# Brunekager

<BlogTextWrapper>

This recipe is from my ex-colleague Helena. It's her great-great-grandmother's recipe, and it's definitely the best I've tried since moving to Denmark. At Christmas time, making and sharing small biscuits is a traditional passtime, and is very common at work and among friends.

### Method

1. Melt the butter, syrup and sugars together until boiling point in a large saucepan.

2. Take the pan off the heat, add spices, nuts, sugar, and grated lemon and orange peel.

3. Add potaske dissolved in a little water. Finally stir in flour.

4. Knead the dough and shape it into sausages, approx. 5 cm in diameter. Set aside in the fridge until cold and firm, possibly overnight.

5. Cut sausages into thin slices and bake for 5-6 min. at a maximum of 200C. Watch them the whole time and don't let them get dark.
