# Cheese Fondue

<BlogTextWrapper>

Freyja requested cheese fondue on day. I'm not sure where she heard about it, but it sounded like a fun idea. I was intimidated, as I've never made it before and it seemed a bit culturally foreign to me. I read a bunch of recipes and they where all pretty similar, so I agregated them and made this. It worked out really well. The gruyere comes in 175g blocks - otherwise I would have used 200g, but you just need 400g total grated cheese.

### Ingredients

- 175g gruyere
- 225g emmental
- 200ml dry white wine
- 2tsp cornflour
- 1 tblsp kirsch or schnapps
- 1 garlic clove, halved
- 1 tblsp lemon juice
- carrots cut into dipable batons
- cubed crusty bread, toasted
- boiled new potatoes (the tiny ones)
- cornichons
- radishes
- radicchio

### Method

1. Pour the wine and lemon juice into a heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat, with the garlic clove and warm until steaming.

2. Add all of the cheese, a handful at a time, whisking between each addition until all the cheese has been added. Continue to stir for 4-5 minutes until everything is fully melted, smooth and creamy.

3. Remove the garlic clove from the mixture. Mix the cornflour with the kirsch in a small bowl, then stir this into the cheese mixture. Continue to cook over a low heat for a minute more.

4. Pour the cheese mixture into the serving pot and immediately place it over the flame. Serve immediately with all the dippers. You can place the fondue back over a low heat if you need to reheat it after serving.
