# Pizza sauce

<BlogTextWrapper>

We're having friends over for pizza tonight. I've just gone to make the sauce, and I couldn't remember the ingredients from last year ðŸ™„. My husband got a pizza oven during the pandemic, as it was a great way to have people over, but we could all hang out outside on the deck. It's a great way to feed a crowd. My husband runs the show, makes the dough, and cooks the pizzas, so it's a very relaxed way to have people around for me. But I've taken over responsibility for the sauce. I prefer herbs chopped and in small pieces, as a rule. So instead of placing whole leaves of basil on top of a pizza, I chop basil and add it into the sauce for the flavour to infuse. You don't need to double up on the basil, so either add it into the sauce as I do here, or skip it in the sauce and add leaves on top of your pizza.

### Ingredients

- 400g can best quality whole tomatoes (must be whole, chopped will not work)

- 1/2 tsp flaky sea salt
- 1 clove crushed garlic
- 3 stalks of basil, leaves pulled off

### Method

1. Pour the tinned tomatoes into a fine sieve, over a bowl, to catch the watery liquid. Spread the tomatoes evenly around the outside of the sieve, so that there is a space in the middle for the liquid to drain to. Split the whole tomatoes down the middle to allow the liquid to drain from inside of the tomatoes. Leave to drain overnight or for four hours.

2. Scrape the tomatoes into bowl, add the olive oil, salt, and garlic. Blend with a stick blender.

3. Add the chopped basil and give it a good stir. Cover with cling film and leave in the fridge for a few hours - for the flavours to develop.
