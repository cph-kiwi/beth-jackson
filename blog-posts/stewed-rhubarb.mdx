# Stewed Rhubarb

<BlogTextWrapper>

I'm lucky to have friends and family with gardens and an abundence of rhubarb in the early summer. I'm never quite sure what to do with it as I can never remember how much sugar to use. This is how I'm preparing it at the moment. The children don't like it.

### Ingredients

- 400g trimmed, chopped rhubarb
- 100g sugar
- A small piece of ginger, peeled and grated
- the zest of 1/2 an orange
- 2 tblsp fresh orange juice

### Method

1. Combine everything in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 10 minutes. Try not to be too vigorous, otherwise the rhubarb will break up.

2. Strain the rhubarb to collect the liquid. Pour the liquid back into the saucepan and bring to the boil again. Simmer to reduce for 10 minutes.

3. I store the rhubarb and the liquid separately. I like to serve the rhubarb with vanilla greek yoghurt, and the syrup poured over the top.
