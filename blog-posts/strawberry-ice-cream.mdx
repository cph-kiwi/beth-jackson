Andreas got an ice cream maker for his birthday, and this was the first recipe he tried. It's the first time I've ever thought strawberry ice cream is nice.

### Method

1. In a large bowl, mix together the strawberries, honey, sugar, and lemon juice. Allow to sit for 15-20 minutes, or until the strawberries have released their juices.

2. Mash the mixture until there are no longer any large strawberry pieces.

3. Add the milk and vanilla extract to the strawberry mixture and stir to combine.

4. Whip the cream, then gently fold it into the strawberry mixture.

5. Pour into the ice cream maker and follow the manufacturer's instructions.
