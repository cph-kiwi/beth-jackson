# Lemon drizzle cake

<BlogTextWrapper>

This cake freezes very well. I cut it into slices and wrap each one individually in cling film. Then I freeze them and get them out one at a time when the children feel like cake.

### Method

1. Heat oven to 180°C fan-forced. Line a 22cm loaf tin with paper.

2. Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.

3. Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined. Spoon the mixture into the tin and level the top with a spoon.

4. Bake for 50 minutes until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.

5. While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.

6. Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle. Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve.
