# Mince on toast

<BlogTextWrapper>

Kiwi classic. Super easy and comforting dinner or lunch. Double the batch and freeze some for an easy dinner later. I ran out of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce one time, but substituted it with a tablespoon of marmite and it still tasted great.

### Method

1. Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion, carrot and celery with a good pinch of salt until very tender and lightly golden.

2. Add the mince, breaking it up so there are no large lumps and cook for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.

3. Increase the heat and stir in the tomato paste. Cook for 1 minute then add the mustard, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and sugar and combine well.

4. Add the stock and season well. Bring to the boil then simmer briskly for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until reduced and glossy.

5. Mix the cornflour with a little hot water and then add it to the pan. Roughly crush the mixture with a potato masher or the back of the spoon against the side of the pot, as it helps to bring in all together. At the last minute, stir the parsely through.

To serve, pile straight onto buttered toast or top the toast with wilted greens then the mince, a fried or poached egg and a spoonful of relish, or top with grated cheddar.
