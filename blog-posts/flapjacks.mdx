<BlogTextWrapper>

These are very simple and easy to make. The children will eat them, need I say more? Great if you need to take a snack for a picnic or road trip.

### Ingredients

- 150g golden syrup
- 150g butter
- 135g sugar
- 300g porridge oats
- pinch of salt

### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 150 degrees Celsius fan forced. Cut some baking paper to fit up the sides of the tin. Crumble the paper into a ball, and then flatten it out again. Place it in the tin, ready for the mixture.

2. Place the syrup, butter and sugar in a large saucepan, and heat on medium for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until completely melted.

3. Tip in the oats and a pinch of salt, and stir until completely coated in the syrup mixture. Tip the mixture into a lined baking tin and bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown on top. They will continue cooking as they cool.

4. Leave them to cool completely in the tin. Do not touch them! Then pull them out by the paper and cut into bars. Store in an airtight container.
