# American potato salad

<BlogTextWrapper>

Between this salad and the <u>[tangy potato salad](https://cph.kiwi/blog/tangy-potato-salad)</u> posted earlier, all of my potato salad desires are covered. Step 1 is best done much earlier than the rest of the prep, like the evening or morning before.

### Ingredients

- 700g potatoes, peeled or unpeeled, cut to the size you'd like when serving them (I like golf ball sized)
- 2 large gherkins, quartered length-ways and then chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1/2 red onion, chopped
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled, chopped
- 80ml mayonnaise
- 1 tblsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tblsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tblsp minced fresh dill
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Method

1. Place potatoes in a sauce pan and cover with well salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes. Drain and cool completely.

2. Transfer the potatoes to large bowl. Add gherkins, celery, onion, and eggs. Combine mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and dill in a small bowl. Stir about half of the dressing into the salad, gently stirring to coat everything evenly. Add more dressing to taste, and season well with salt and pepper.
