# Five-spice chicken marinade

<BlogTextWrapper>

I'm a bit obessed with five-spice. I have to stop myself from drinking this from the pan after I've made some chicken with this recipe. I think this works best if you marinade the chicken overnight. Works well with drumsticks, and over rice. This is for 1 kg of chicken.

### Method

1. Put all of the ingredients into a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the chicken and allow to marinate while you preheat the oven to 180Â°C Fan.

2. Put the chicken drumsticks on a roasting tray and roast for 40 minutes, or until the skin is golden and the chicken is cooked through. Turn once during cooking.
