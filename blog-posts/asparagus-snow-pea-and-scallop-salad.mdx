# Asparagus, sugarsnap pea, and scallop salad

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is inspired by a recipe from Annabel Langbein's The Free Range Cook. This is as extravagant as home cooking gets for me. I love seafood, and it's much more affordable to make it at home than to eat it at a restaurant. And this way I can eat as much as I like. In addition to the scallops, sometimes I add prawns to fill it out a bit.

### Method

1. Place the dressing ingredients into a lidded jar and shake to combine. Refridgerate.

2. Place a large pot of water on to boil. Pour cold water into a large bowl and add ice. Add the asparagus to the boiling water for 3 minutes, then add the sugarsnap peas for 1 minute. Drain, and then quickly transfer to the bowl of ice water. Leave to cold for a few minutes, then drain well.

3. Place the lettuce, asparagus, sugarsnap peas and avocado in a large bowl.

4. Mix the scallops with the zest and season with salt, pepper and sugar. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan on a high heat. Cook the scallops for 40-50 seconds on each side.

5. Place the scallops on top of the salad, and pour the dressing over the top.

I serve this with crusty bread and butter.
