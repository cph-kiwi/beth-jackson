# Elzekaria

<BlogTextWrapper>

My husband was away at a conference and I was feeding the children and their unexpected neighbourhood friends for a couple of days. Needless to say, there were a lot of white carbs on the menu, and I felt like I needed some hearty veg without a trip to the supermarket. I always have cannellini beans in the cupboard, so I thought I'd give this a go.

### Ingredients

- olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- salt
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 400g can of cannellini beans
- 1/4 head of cabbage, sliced
- 500ml chicken stock
- 250ml water
- Parsley or dill, chopped
- drizzle of white wine vinegar

#### Optional

- juice of 1/2 a lemon

### Method

1. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium/low heat. Add the onion and salt, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Don't let the onion brown. Add the garlic and cook for another 5 minutes.

2. Add the beans, cabbage, chicken stock and water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 1 hour covered, on a medium/low heat.

3. Add the dill or parsley. Ladle into bowls and drizzle with white wine vinegar to serve.
