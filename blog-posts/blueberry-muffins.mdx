# Blueberry muffins

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is a pretty standard muffin recipe. I don't know where I got it from. It's very easy and fast. I always have some blueberries in the freezer, ready to go.

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 200Â°C fan.

2. Place the flour, baking powder, sugar and lemon zest in a large bowl.

3. Place the egg, olive oil, milk, and lemon juice in another bowl. Beat thoroughly.

4. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined. Add the blueberries (if frozen, don't thaw).

5. Spoon into well greased, deep muffin tins. Bake for 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
