# Mustard pork filets

<BlogTextWrapper>

I used to make this for myself as a treat when my ex-husband would travel for work. He didn't like it. However, my current husband asks for it regularly ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I've written the recipe below how Nigella writes it, but I change up the flavour combos. I'm not a fan of grainy mustard, so I prefer dijon and champagne or sparkling wine instead of the cider. I buy one of those little mini bottles of cheap champagne if I'm going to make this.

### Ingredients

- 1 tblsp olive oil
- 125 ml cider
- 1 tblsp grainy mustard
- 75 ml double cream
- 500g gnocchi

### Method

1. Put a pot of water on to boil, for the gnocchi.

2. Cut the fat or rind off the pork. Nigella says to bash them with a rollingpin to make them thinner, but I've never bothered with this step.

3. Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan and cook the pork over a moderately high heat for about 5 minutes a side. Remove them to a warmed plate and wrap them in tin foil.

4. Add the gnocchi to the pot of boiling and cook according to the packet instructions.

5. Pour the cider/champagne into the pan, still over the heat, to de-glaze the pan. Let it bubble away for a minute or so, then add the mustard and stir in the cream. Let the sauce continue cooking for a few minutes.

6. When you have drained the gnocchi, add them to the pan with the sauce and stir them around well.

7. Plate up the pork, then spoon the gnocchi and sauce over the top of each filet.
