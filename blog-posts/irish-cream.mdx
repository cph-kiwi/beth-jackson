# Irish cream

<BlogTextWrapper>

This recipe is from Deb Perelman at Smitten Kitchen. It takes five minutes and is so delicious.

### Ingredients

- 1 tsp cocoa powder
- 235ml whipping cream
- 1 can of sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 tsp vanilla paste
- 235ml Irish whiskey (I use Tullamore Dew, but Jameson is nice too)

### Method

1. Sift the cocoa into a mixing bowl (sifting here is very important to avoid lumps!). Adding the cream a spoonful at a time, whisk the cream into the cocoa powder.

2. Pour in the condensed milk, and whisk well. Then add the vanilla and finally the whiskey. Whisk well again.

3. Pour into a lidded bottle and store in the fridge.

This will last in the fridge for two weeks, but good luck to you not to drink it all within a week. I enjoy this very cold, from the fridge over ice. It is also delicious (and dangerous) in coffee.
