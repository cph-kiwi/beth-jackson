### Ingredients

- 2 tblsp buckwheat flour (boghvedemel på dansk)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp vanilla sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 2 eggs
- 2 tblsp crunchy peanut butter
- 2 bananas, mashed
- chocolate buttons

### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C fan bake. Either place 8 muffin cases into a muffin tin, or grease the muffin tin with rapeseed oil.

2. Sift the flour, cinnamon, vanilla sugar, and baking powder into a small bowl.

3. Beat the eggs in another bowl. Add in the peanut butter and mashed bananans. Beat again. Add the dry ingredients and stir together. It will still be fairly runny.

4. Pour and divide between 8 muffin cases. Share the chocolate button between them, and poke them under the surface with a butter knife.

5. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool.
