### Method

1. Preheat oven to 190°C. Halve each aubergine down the middle, stalk to base. Use a sharp knife to make diagonal cuts deep into the cut side of the flesh, going almost through to the skin but not quite, about 1.5cm apart. Repeat the other way, to create a diamond pattern.

2. Measure out 2 tblsp of the oil, and brush it all over the cut side of the aubergine. Push the garlic slices into the cuts. Season well with salt and pepper. Put the aubergine halves in a large roasting dish and bake for 30 minutes.

3. Combine the onion, balsamic vinegar, sugar, tomato purée, sultanas or raisins and remaining tablespoon of oil in a large bowl. Mix well, then stir in the tomatoes.

4. After the first 30 minutes, add the onion and tomato mixture to the roasting dish, pushing it around the aubergine halves so that they are not covered. Trickle 100ml water over the tomatoes and onions (not the aubergines!) and return to the oven for a final 30 minutes.

5. As soon as the dish comes out of the oven, spoon the onions and tomatoes on top of the aubergines. Leave to settle for 10 minutes, then serve scattered with the pin nuts and parsley or mint.

Serve with rice to soak up the delicious juices.
