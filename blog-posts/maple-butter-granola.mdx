# Maple butter granola

This is my own recipe, based on four different recipes that I combined. I have developed it to my taste, so it is sweet. If you don't have a sweet tooth, just leave out the raw sugar. The maple syrup doesn't add much sweetness, so don't reduce the amount there. I strongly recommend adding the buckwheat. It gives the most amazing crunch.

### Ingredients

- 75g butter
- 150ml maple syrup
- 1/2 tsp salt (I use maldon, so use less if using table salt)
- 200g oats
- 100g buckwheat
- 50g chia seeds
- 50g linseeds
- 50g sunflower seeds
- 50g pumpkin seeds
- 4 tblsp raw sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp mixed spice
- 1 1/2 tsp all spice
- 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 150g flaked or chopped almonds
- 3 egg whites
- 100g raisins
- 100g chopped dried apricots

### Method

1. Grease a large roasting tin with butter or olive oil. Preheat oven to 150°C.

2. Put the butter, maple syrup and salt in a saucepan and melt gently. Bring to a boil and then take off the heat to cool a little.

3. In a large bowl, combine the oats, buckwheat, chia seeds, linseeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sugar, spices, and almonds. Give it a good stir.

4. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites until it holds peaks.

5. Pour the butter liquid into the dry ingredients and stir. Add the egg whites and gently fold in until completely incorporated.

6. Pour into the roasting tin and spread to evenly cover the space. Pat it down firmly with the back of a spoon. This will help clumps to form in the final product.

7. Bake for 30 minutes. After 15 minutes, stir carefully so as not to break it up too much.

8. Reduce temperature to 130°C and bake for another 15 minutes. Stir carefully so as not to break it up too much.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={15} inputSeconds={0} />

9. Reduce temperature to 100°C and bake for a final 15 minutes.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={15} inputSeconds={0} />

10. Turn off the oven and remove the tin. Add the raisins and apricots, gently stirring them through. Return the tin to the oven, but leave the oven off. This helps it dry out even more. I leave it in the oven overnight.

Store in an airtight container. It will last for two weeks.
