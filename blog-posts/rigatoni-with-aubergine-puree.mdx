# Rigatoni with aubergine purée

<BlogTextWrapper>

I make this pasta dish when I've already make the classic child-friendly pesto pasta (with hidden broccoli) and pasta in marinara sauce and I need a change. Pasta is my daughter's favourite, so I try and mix up the veg she gets with it, if I can get away with it. It's another recipe from Deb Perelman. I always have the same hassle with every American recipe - the trouble is in translating the quantities, but once that's done they work well.

### Ingredients

- 1 aubergine, cut into cubes
- approximately 250g cherry tomatoes, whatever size your country's containers come in
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 6 tblsp olive oil
- 1 tsp flaky sea salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1/2 tsp chili flakes
- 400g rigatoni
- basil, chopped
- 50g parmesan, grated
- 40g toasted pine nuts

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 200°C. Put some greaseproof paper on a baking tray.

2. Put the aubergine, tomatoes, garlic, 3 tblsp olive oil, salt, pepper, and chili flakes in a large bowl. Mix together to coat everything in the oil.

3. Spread the veg out in an even layer on the baking tray. Roast in the oven for 35 minutes, or until looking toasty and golden. Stir once during cooking.

4. While that's in the oven, cook the rigatoni in well-salted water. Reserve some of the cooking water when draining.

5. Using a food processor or stick blender, mix the veg together with 3 tblsp olive oil, and blend until smooth.

6. Return the pasta to the cooking pot, add the blended sauce and a good splash of the cooking water, and cook together for a couple of minutes until the pasta is well coated. Add more cooking water as required until the sauce is the desired consistency. I find I always need to add more water than I think I will need, over 3 soup ladles full. Add the basil, parmesan, and pine nuts, and mix well.
