# Lemon yoghurt cake

<BlogTextWrapper>

This cake is objectively better than the lemon drizzle cake. It's softer and looks nicer. The sauce on this one is incredible. The other cake is better for a picnic, freezing, or taking somewhere.

### Method

1. Heat oven to 170°C. Grease and line a 20cm round cake tin with paper.

2. Cream the caster sugar, butter and lemon zest until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and mix briefly to combine.

3. Sift in the flour and baking powder. Mix briefly, then add the yoghurt and mix until well combined.

4. Pour into prepared tin and bake for 45 minutes, until cake springs back when lightly pressed on top, and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in tin for 15 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.

5. While the cake cooks, place the lemon juice and caster sugar in small saucepan and heat gently without stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Can be used warm or cool.
