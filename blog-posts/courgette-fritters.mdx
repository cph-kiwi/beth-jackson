# Courgette fritters

<BlogTextWrapper>

These are a delicious way of eating courgettes. I started making them for my babies, as this recipe is from a baby-led weaning book. However, it's easy to make them for grownups with the addition of lemon zest grated in and salt.

- 30g plain flour
- 1 egg, lightly beaten

### Method

1. Squeeze the grated courgette in a clean tea towel to remove any excess water, then tip it into a large bowl. Stir in the flour, egg, parmesan and mint (if using), to make a loose batter.

2. Heat enough oil to coat the base of a large, nonstick frying pan over a medium heat. Add 1 heaped tablespoon of the courgette mixture per fritter and cook in 2 batches for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden. Drain on kitchen paper before serving.
