# Raspberry overnight oats

<BlogTextWrapper>

I found a premix powder pack for overnight oats at the supermarket, but it was on the end of the aisle and I doubt if I'll ever see it available again. I looked at the ingredients and this is what I've come up with. It has replaced the peach overnight oats for me because it is more convenient, although the peach ones are nicer. I make this up in a big bag, and then each evening, I just scope some into a bowl with yoghurt and milk and leave it in the fridge overnight.
