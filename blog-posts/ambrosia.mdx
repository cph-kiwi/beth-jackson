# Ambrosia

<BlogTextWrapper>

My mum used to make this when I was a kid. It's the dessert I remember most from childhood. It is only now that I have learned this is a uniquely Kiwi dish. This is barely a recipe. It's easy to whip together quickly ahead of time, and is child-friendly. I have based this on the recipe by Annabel Langbein, as previously I was just throwing things together and the result was a bit varied.

### Ingredients

- 315ml whipping cream
- 315ml berry-flavoured yoghurt (should be sweetened yoghurt)
- 110g mini marshmellows
- 65g mini meringues (marengskys in Danish)
- 250g raspberries

### Method

1. Place the cream in a big bowl and whip to soft peaks. Fold through yoghurt, meringues, and marshmallows, then gently fold in the raspberries without crushing.

2. Spoon into glasses or serve in one large bowl.

You can serve this immediately but I think it's better if you cover and refrigerate for a few hours before serving.
