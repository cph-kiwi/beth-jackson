# Whisky hot toddy

<BlogTextWrapper>

When I was at uni, my flatmate Sam made me a hot lemon and honey drink when I was ill one time. I loved it, and my next thought was "the only thing that could make this better is whisky". I was reading about the history of hot toddys, having thought they were always made with whisky, but actually the recipe is a lot more loose than that. This recipe is more like a traditional grog, but with whisky instead of rum.
