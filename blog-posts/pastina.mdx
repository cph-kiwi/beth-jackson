# Pastina

<BlogTextWrapper>

Think porridge but with pasta. Quick and easy lunch or for when tired, ill or hungover. I like the tiny star-shaped pasta, but you can use any small shape like orzo or alphabet. I'm just going to write the basic recipe here, but you can just cook to optional bits first. I cook the pancetta and then remove it, then cook the carrot and leek. I add the stock to the carrot and leek, and then add the pancetta back at the end.
