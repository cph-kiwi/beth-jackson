# Sausage rolls

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is a standard of bakeries and cafés around New Zealand. Commonly eaten for lunch or a warm snack on a cold day. They're best hot and fresh from the oven, but are acceptable cut small and served cold for party food. My husband likes to make these and Danish pølserhorn, and serve them together as multicultural sausage rolls. If making them for lunch, I cut them to be around 7cm, but for party snacks, around 2cm.

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 220°C fanbake. Combine sausagemeat, onion, tomato sauce, Worchester sauce, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well.

2. You may need to flour your board, but if I'm using premade, prerolled pastry, then I don't bother. Basically you want 10cm wide strips of pastry. I find it easier to handle if they're only as long as the board I'm making them on. Form the meat mixture into a sausage shape down the middle. Brush the length of one edge with water. Fold the unwatered length over and seal with the watered length.

3. Carefully slice into the length you want, either around 7cm for meal-sized, maybe for a picnic, or 2cm sized, for a party.

4. Place them join side down on a lined baking sheet, allowing a little room for the pastry to puff up.

5. Mix the egg yolk with 1 tblsp water. Brush the tops with this mixture. I like to sprinkle seasame seeds over the top.

6. Bake for 15 minutes, but keep an eye on them. They may be done before then.
