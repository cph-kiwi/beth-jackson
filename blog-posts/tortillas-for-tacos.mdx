# Tortillas for tacos

<BlogTextWrapper>

We prefer to make our own tortillas when we have tacos at home. It took a few tries before we got something that was soft enough that it didn't crack and split around the food. I say "we" because I tend to measure out the ingredients into a bowl, and then I get on with taco fillings while my husband does the kneeding and cooking of the tortillas.

### Ingredients

- 200g wholemeal flour
- 120ml water
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Method

1. In a bowl, mix the flour, salt and water to form a dough. Knead for a few minutes. If you need to make other things for the tacos, this is a good point to set the dough aside in a bowl covered with a tea towel.

2. Divide the dough into 10 small balls, and roll out each one thinly. Cook each through in a non-stick pan for just a minute on each side until soft, turning when you see bubbles.

3. Fold a piece of foil in half and set that inside a tea towel that has been folded in half. Place the tortillas inside the foil to stay warm until it is time to eat.
