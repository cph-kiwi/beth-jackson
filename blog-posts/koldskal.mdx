# Koldskål

This is regularly eaten in the summer in Denmark. To be honest, I'm not sure if it's a snack or lunch or dinner. We tend to have it for lunch or dinner on hot days when we can't stand the idea of being in the kitchen, and we don't want anything heavy to eat. You can buy this already made in a carton, but it's not much more work to make it from scratch and it's worth it for the flavour.

### Ingredients

- 2 egg yolks
- 3 tblsp sugar
- 1 tsp vailla paste
- juice of 1/2 a lemon
- 1/2 litre buttermilk (kærnemælk)
- 1/2 litre very thin plain pouring yoghurt (A38 tykmælk)
- crumbly butter bicuits or shortbread (kammerjunkere)

### Method

1. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks, sugar and vanilla together.

2. Add the lemon juice, buttermilk, and thin yoghurt. Mix it all together until combined.

If not eating straight away, store in the fridge. When serving, crumble the biscuits a little (or if you are like me, pummel them into a fine rubble with a mortar and pestle), and scatter on top of the koldskål.
