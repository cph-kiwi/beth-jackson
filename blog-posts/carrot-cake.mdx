# Carrot Cake

<BlogTextWrapper>

This recipe is my Mum's. I don't know where she got it from. My ex-husband asked for it when we got divorced - it was the one thing of mine he wanted. I said "No". I'm petty, I know. Anyway, here it is for the entire internet.

I've written below how I do this, but my Mum bakes the lot in a 23cm tin and doesn't do a sandwich situation. She bakes it for 1 hour and 10 minutesShe uses half the amount of icing I have written here.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup wholemeal flour
- 1 cup plain white flour
- 2 tsp baking soda
- 2 cups raw sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1 cup oil (I have used rapeseed or olive oil)
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 3 cups grated carrots

#### Icing

- 240g full fat cream cheese
- 120g softened butter (just leave it out on the counter for an hour before using)
- 4 cups icing sugar (500g)
- 2 tsp vanilla paste

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Grease two 21cm round cake tins. Line with baking paper.

2. Combine the flours, baking soda, raw sugar, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl.

3. Make a well. Tip the grated carrot into the well. Combine the oil and eggs in a bowl. Pour into the well on top of the carrots. Stir well.

4. Bake for 55 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.

5. Leave cakes to cool completely. Combine the cream cheese, butter and vanilla in a bowl. Beat gently until smooth. Add in the icing sugar and stir to combine. Once it is coming together, beat gently. Spread 1/3 on top of one cake, stack the second one on top, then spread the rest over the top and sides. Store in the fridge.
