# Sticky rice with broccoli and butternut

This recipe is from Rukmini Iyer's The Green Roasting Tin. It's a new recipe for us, and it's a winner. We'll definitely make this again, although it wasn't a hit with the kid. I left out the chilli, and I didn't include ginger in the dressing out of laziness. I've written it below as I actually made it, rather than how the recipe dictates.

### Ingredients

- 150g jasmine rice
- 1 x 400ml tin of coconut milk
- 1 tblsp soy sauce
- 2.5cm ginger, grated
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 400g butternut, cubed
- 1 head of broccoli, cut into small florets
- 30g toasted cashews
- 20g coriander, finely chopped

### Dressing

- 2 tblsp sesame oil
- 2 tblsp lime juice (the juice of two limes)
- 2 tblsp soy sauce

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 180°C fan or 200°C. Mix the rice, coconut milk, soy sauce, ginger and garlic in a small roasting tin. Scatter the butternut on top. Cover tightly with foil, and place in the oven for 45 minutes.

2. Scatter the broccoli on top of everything and secure the foil tightly again. Return to the oven for 15 minutes.

3. Mix the dressing ingredients together.

4. To serve, spoon some of the roasted rice and veg into bowls and pour over some of the dressing. Scatter some cashews and coriander over the top.
