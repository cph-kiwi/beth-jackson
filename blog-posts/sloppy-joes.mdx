# Sloppy joes

<BlogTextWrapper>

I am not American and didn't eat this as a child. I only started making it when I was desperate for new ideas for dinners my kid might eat. Turns out my husband and I like this one, but my kid will only eat the brioche buns with it. What can you do? I don't know if there is such a thing as an authentic Sloppy joe recipe, but I settled on this one after playing around with a recipe from Jaclyn at Cooking Classy. This makes a huge batch. I split it into smaller containers, and freeze them for a quick dinner in the future.

- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 tsp chili powder

- 1 1/2 tsp mustard powder

### Method

1. Heat the oil and melt the butter together in a large sauce pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, and pepper, and cook until the onion is clear. Push the veg to one side of the pan.

2. Add the beef to the other side of the pan, and sear until browned on the bottom. Start to break it up and incorporate into the veg. Cook until most of the beef is browned.

3. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.

4. Add the chili powder, paprika, mustard, salt and pepper. Cook for another minute.

5. Add the passata, tomato sauce, BBQ sauce, and Worchestershire sauce. Simmer for as long as you can, or 20 minutes, with the lid off. This is best when it is really thick, so the longer it cooks the better. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

6. Split the buns in half and toast them under the oven grill until golden. To eat these, spoon some of the mince into a bun and top with coleslaw.

I like to serve this with corn on the cob, potato salad or coleslaw.
