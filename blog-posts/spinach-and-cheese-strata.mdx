# Spinach and cheese strata

<BlogTextWrapper>

The first time I heard of strata was in the 2005 film The Family Stone. Sarah Jessica Parker's character ends up covered in it, and then I had to make it to find out what it tasted like. I found a recipe for the one in the movie, but actually, it wasn't that good. This one, however, is really tasty. I love that I can make it the day before I have guests, meaning that I'm a bit less rushed and stressed day of.

2. Spread one third of the bread cubes in a well-buttered lasagna dish. Top with one-third of spinach mixture and one-third of each cheese. Repeat layering twice with remaining bread, spinach and cheese.

3. Whisk eggs, milk, mustard and remaining 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper together in a large bowl and pour evenly over strata. Cover with plastic wrap and chill strata for eat least 8 hours or up to a day.

4. The next day, let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes while preheating the oven to 180°C. Bake strata, uncovered, in middle of oven until puffed, golden brown, and cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes. If it starts to look too brown and the egg isn't set, cover with foil for the remainder of the cooking time. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
