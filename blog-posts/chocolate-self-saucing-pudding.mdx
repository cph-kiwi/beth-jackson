# Chocolate self saucing pudding

<BlogTextWrapper>

This dessert is a kiwi classic. It is one of the first things I remember learning to make when I was in manual education cooking classes at age 11 - 12. It's also delicious!

### Method

1. Make the sauce mix by mixing the ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Grease a large pyrex-type oven-safe pudding dish.

2. Beat the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla together.

3. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and cocoa. Fold this gentle into the butter mixture. Spoon into greased pudding dish.

4. Sprinkle the sauce mixture over the top. Carefully pour boiling water over the back of a spoon onto the pudding. Bake for 35 minutes or until the pudding springs back when lightly touched.

Serve with ice cream or whipped cream, and some berries on the side.
