I made this up! And this is my first recipe request! All very exciting for me.

### Ingredients

- 60g chia seeds
- 400ml can of coconut milk
- 2 tblsp cocoa powder for a lighter dessert, or 3 tblsp for more of a bitter dark chocolate effect
- 2 tblsp maple syrup (honey is a fine substitute)
- 1 tsp vanilla paste (or extract)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 6 tblsp yoghurt

### Method

1. Tip the seeds into a mixing bowl. Pour in the coconut milk, and sift the cocoa powder over the top.

2. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix really thoroughly.

3. Pour into 5 individual cups (or 6 if you want smaller servings), and place in the fridge overnight to set.

They'll be good in the fridge for up to 4 days. You can add garnishs to them like chopped fruit or nuts, or a coulis.
