# Brussels sprouts

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is definitely not a recipe, just how I like to prepare Brussels sprouts. Once I started doing them like this, I haven't prepared them another way.

### Method

1. Wash the sprouts. Trim the bottoms and peel away any tough outer leaves. Cut them in half and place in a bowl.

2. Drizzle over some olive oil and sprinkle over some salt. Toss them until they are well coated. Place them cut side down on metal baking sheet.

3. Bake for 20 minutes at 180Â°C fan forced. When 20 mins are up, I slide a fish slice under them to make sure they're not sticking, and then place them back in the oven. I turn the oven off and leave them to stay warm until everything else is ready (not more than 10 minutes).
