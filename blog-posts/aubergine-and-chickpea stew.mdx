# Aubergine and chickpea stew

<BlogTextWrapper>

I used to make big batches of ratatouille to freeze for quick dinners on weeknights. But it always ended up sloppy and a bit flavourless. I think this recipe works much better. It is fast, so the veg stays a bit fresher and has more bite. I make the vegetarian version of this with aubergine, so it is more like a ratatouille, however the original recipe used 250g pork fillet (tenderloin) instead. I serve this with rice, but crusty bread would work too.

- 1 courgette halved lengthways and sliced into semi circles

### Method

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large sauce pan. Add the aubergine and cook for a few minutes until starting to colour. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate.

2. Add the remaining oil, the onion, pepper and courgette to the pan. Cook until softened and lightly browned, stirring regularly.

3. Add the garlic, paprika, chickpeas and tinned tomatoes. Half-fill the empty tomato tin with water and add to the pan. Add the stock cube and add the aubergine back. Bring to a gentle simmer for 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened, stirring regularly.
