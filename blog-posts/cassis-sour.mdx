# Cassis Sour

<BlogTextWrapper>

I got a new cocktail shaker, as our old one had begun to leak. I wanted to find a cocktail that required a shaker to test it out. Andreas and I have different tastes in cocktails, so I needed to find one that was sufficiently sweet and fruity for him. Sadly we didn't have any Chambord for a French Martini, but we did have some creme de cassis. I ended up improvising and made this cocktail up. You can make this with vodka if you prefer.
