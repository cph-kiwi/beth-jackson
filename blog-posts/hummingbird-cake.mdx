# Hummingbird cake

<BlogTextWrapper>

I made a Hummingbird cake for both my daughters' first birthday parties. To be fair, I don't think it's a great choice for children, as it's a bit rich. But adding the fruit means there is less sugar added than another cake choice. For Freyja, I made the recipe from Ella's Kitchen, and for Saga I made the one from Jamie Oliver (both recipes are referenced below). However, I have combined the two to make this recipe.

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 160Â°C fan forced and prepare two 23cm cake tins by greasing with butter and lining with paper.

2. In a large bowl, combine both flours, cinnamon, mixed spice, baking powder, and sugar.

3. In another bowl, whisk together the oil, eggs, and vanilla extract.

4. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined.

5. Gently fold in the mashed bananas, pineapple chunks, coconut, and pecans.

6. Divide between prepared tins and bake for 30 minutes.

7. Let them cool in the tins for about 10 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely before icing.

8. To make the icing, combine the icing sugar, butter, cream cheese, lime zest, and lime juice in a bowl. Beat until smooth.
