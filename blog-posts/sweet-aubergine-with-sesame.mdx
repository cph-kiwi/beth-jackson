### Method

1. Cut the aubergine into 1cm thick slices. Score each piece in a criss-cross on both sides, about 2mm deep.

2. In a small bowl, mix the honey and sesame oil. Place the aubergine slices in a single layer on a baking tray. Brush with the honey sesame mixture. Sprinkle over some salt and the sesame seeds.

3. Put them in a single layer in the airfryer. Cook at 190°C for 12 minutes.

4. Flip them over and paint with more honey sesame mixture. Sprinkle over more salt and sesame seeds. Cook at 200°C for 5 minutes.

5. Serve with rice or with some grilled halloumi. You can also mash these into a dip and serve with toasted pitta bread strips.
