# Rødkål

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is a traditional Danish side dish. It is eaten through the year with roast pork, and at the Christmas Eve feast. This can be made the day before and warmed up right before serving. This makes a huge quantity, but I don't really want half a cabbage left over. If you want to make a smaller quantity, check out the link to the original post at the bottom of this page. On th Meyers site, you can easily select the ratios required to make less. It also freezes well.
