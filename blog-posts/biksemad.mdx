# Biksemad

<BlogTextWrapper>

I think many countries have a version of this. Growing up in New Zealand, we called this a fry-up. In the UK they call it hash, and in Denmark it's called biksemad. At its most basic it is leftovers from a roast, cooked up the following day, with an onion, served with an egg on top. The ingredients list here is more the way of ideas of things you could include. For myself, I love it with fennel, dill and creme fraiche. Sorry this recipe is a bit chaotic. It's more a list for me to get ideas from, than a recipe.

### Method

1. Chop everything that needs chopping. I prefer a smaller dice, and this means it cooks faster.

2. If meat is not leftovers, start by cooking the meat. If using bacon, I prefer to cook this without adding oil first. Otherwise add the cooked meat and cooked potatoes at the same time, at the end, just to warm through and brown a little.

3. Heat oil and melt butter in a large lidded pan. Then add the aromatics and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook until soft. Add potatoes now, if uncooked, and cover with a lid. Cook until cooked through, stirring occasionally.

4. In another pan, heat rapeseed oil on a high heat. Crack in an egg per person. Sprinkle salt on top right away. Then spoon some of the oil on top of the egg to help it cook ont he top. Cook to your liking.

5. Serve with the egg on top, a spoonful of creme fraiche on the side, and a liberal scattering of herbs.
