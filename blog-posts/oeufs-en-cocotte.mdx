# Oeufs en cocotte

When I have leftover cream, I get really excited because I can make eggs this way to use it up. I like mine fairly basic, as outlined below, but you can add ham and onions at the bottom, and cheese on top. The only tricky thing here is the timing. It differs depending on your oven, the ramekins, and how you like your eggs done. So you may need to experiement a bit with how long you leave them in the oven.

### Ingredients

- 1 egg per person
- 1 tblsp of cream per person
- salt
- butter

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 190Â°C. Fill a kettle and set it to boil.

2. Grease ramekins very well with butter. Crack an egg into each ramekin. Pour in one tablespoon of cream over the egg. Sprinkle over salt.

3. Pour boiled water into a roasting dish and place the ramekins in the water. The water should come half way up the side of the ramekins.

4. Place the roasting dish in the oven. Cook for 12 minutes.

Serve with buttery toast soldiers.
