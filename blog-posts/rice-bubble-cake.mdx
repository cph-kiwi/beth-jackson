Kids' party cake. It's cultural, what can I say 🤷🏻‍♀️.

### Method

1. Grease a 20cm square baking tin or dish and line with baking paper.

2. Place butter, caster sugar and honey in a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat until butter has melted. Increase heat a little and bring to the boil; boil for 3 minutes.

3. Remove from heat, add rice bubbles and stir well. Transfer to prepared dish and use a spatula to flatten out. Top with sprinkles, and press them down into the top of the cake. Wait until it is completely cool to cut it into squares, the smaller the better in my opinion.
