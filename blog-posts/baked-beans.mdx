# Baked beans

<BlogTextWrapper>

I used to have an amazing recipe for Boston Baked Beans, but I don't know where I got it from. Probably Nigella. Anyway, that recipe took ages. This recipe is quick and easy and is mostly from store cupboard stuff. Winner! It's not as tasty as the other one, but it still tastes pretty good.

### Method

1. Dry fry the bacon in a medium-sized pan, until it is starting to colour. Add the olive oil and onion to the pan, and cook gently until the onion is clear but not colouring, then add the garlic and cook for a further minute.

2. Add the tomatoes, salt, and the butter beans including their liquid. Cook at a gentle simmer for 10 minutes to reduce the liquid down.

3. Add the vinegar and taste. Adjust seasoning as necessary. Stir the basil through just before serving on toasted bread spread with butter.
