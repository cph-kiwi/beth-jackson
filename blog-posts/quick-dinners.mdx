# Quick dinners

<BlogTextWrapper>

My friend Nicola asked me for some ideas for quick dinners when we were chatting recently. Actually, I've found this topic crops up so often with my Mum-friends. So I thought it might be useful, for myself if no one else, to collate a list of ideas. I plan to fill these out with actual recipes over time, but for now, I think this will help. I'll include links to recipes I use where I've already written one. General themes are "breakfast for dinner", "things on toast", and pasta. Please let me know if you have any ideas that I can add to the list.

### Meal ideas

- Beans on toast
- Eggs on toast
- [Pasta in tomoto sauce](https://cph.kiwi/blog/pasta-in-tomato-sauce)
- Cabonara
- Shop-bought smoked salmon and ready-made potato salad from the supermarket (in DK check the "fridge" section, usually near the bacon or fresh pasta)
- Pesto pasta with broccoli
- [Mac and cheese](https://cph.kiwi/blog/macaroni-and-cheese)
- [Mince on toast](https://cph.kiwi/blog/mince-on-toast)
- Tacos
- Quesadillas
- Rugbrød med pålæg (frikadeller, leverpostej, spegepølse, osv.)
- [Courgette fritters](https://cph.kiwi/blog/courgette-fritters)
- Corn fritters
- Stir fry with rice or noodles
- Eggs and cheese in a tortilla wrap
- [Pita "pizzas"](https://cph.kiwi/blog/pita-pizzas)
- Filled pitas (great in this scenario: child A likes meat but hates cheese; child B likes cheese but hates meat. Shout out to Nicola who has to deal with this situation)
- Puff pastry "tarts" (squares of pastry with something spread and/or scattered on top, for example salmon, or pesto and a slice of tomato)
- Pre made flodekartofler with added vegetables and salmon (you'll find this in the fridge section near the bacon and fresh pasta)
- Ma po tofu with rice and cucumber salad
- Burritos
