# Quick dinners

<BlogTextWrapper>

My friend Nicola asked me for some ideas for quick dinners when we were chatting recently. Actually, I've found this topic crops up so often with my Mum-friends. So I thought it might be useful, for myself if no one else, to collate a list of ideas. I plan to fill these out with actual recipes over time, but for now, I think this will help. I'll include links to recipes I use where I've already written one. General themes are "breakfast for dinner" and "things on toast". Please let me know if you have any ideas that I can add to the list.
