# Baked potatoes

<BlogTextWrapper>

The ultimate easy lunch when working from home. It takes five minutes to prepare the potatoes and stick them in the oven, and you'll thank yourself at lunch time.

### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220째C/200째C fan. Prepare one potato per person. Scrub the potatoes well, and prick them with a fork.

2. Rub a little olive oil over each potato and then sprinkle some salt over and rub it in.

3. Put the potatoes directly on a rack in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn down the oven to 190째C/170째C fan and bake for one hour more until the skin is crisp and the inside soft.

4. Make a cross in the centre of each potato, dollop over the topping and serve.
