# Parsnip and apple soup

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is a recipe from an English soup book my friend has, but I don't know the name of it. I'll try to reference it properly in the future.

### Ingredients

- 60g butter

- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 large apple, chopped
- 500g parsnip, roughly chopped
- 1 litre vegetable stock

### Method

1. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the onion and celery. Cook gently for 10 minutes. Mince the garlic and add it to the pot. Cook for another 2 minutes.

2. Add the spices, apple and parsnip. Cook for another 5 minutes.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={5} inputSeconds={0} />

3. Add the stock and simmer for 20 minutes.

<Timer inputHours={0} inputMinutes={20} inputSeconds={0} />

4. Add the cream and lemon juice. Blend with a stick blender, then taste to check the seasoning. Add up to 200ml more water if it needs thinning a little.

If the celery has a leafy top, I like to chop up a bit and scatter it on top for a garnish. It also tastes great.
