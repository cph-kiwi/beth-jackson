# Sausage pasta

<BlogTextWrapper>

My friend made this one day, when I'd come over after work to babysit, and she was in a rush to get something on the table and then get out the door for her date. It is really tasty for the amount of effort required.

### Ingredients

- 4 spring onions
- 1 carrot
- 1 celery stick
- 1 fresh red chilli
- 6 good quality sausages (in Denmark, I use a medisterp√∏lse, but you need around 400g of sausage meat)
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tblsp olive oil
- 500g penne pasta
- 4 garlic cloves
- 4 tblsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
- parmesan
- fresh basil

### Method

1. Roughly chop the spring onion, carrot and celery, and blitz in the food processor with the chilli. Remove the sausage casing and add the meat to the food processor, with the fennel seeds and oregano. Pulse until well mixed.

2. Place a frying pan over a medium/high heat with the olive oil. When the pan is hot, spoon the mixture into the pan. Stir and break it up as it cooks as it will want to lump together.

3. Put the pasta water on to boil. Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions.

4. Crush the garlic cloves and add to the sausage mixture, along with the balsamic vinegar and tinned tomatoes. Add a splash of the pasta water as well.

5. Drain the pasta and reserve some of the water. Tip the pasta into the sauce and add more pasta water as needed. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Sprinkle the parmesan and basil over the top when serving.
