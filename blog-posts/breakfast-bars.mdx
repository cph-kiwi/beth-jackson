# Breakfast bars

This recipe is from Rukmini Iyer's The Roasting Tin. I make these when I'm going away overnight and I'm concerned that I might get hungry or that breakfast won't be organised.

### Ingredients

- 175g grated apple (I use 2 apples)
- 75g chopped dates
- 75g golden syrup (lys sirup in Denmark)
- 100g sugar
- 125g butter
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 75g dried cranberries
- 50g pistachios
- 200g oats
- 75g desiccated coconut

### Method

1. Grease and line a small baking tin. Grate the apples and chop the dates. Preheat oven to 150Â°C fan.

2. Heat the golden syrup, sugar, butter, and cinnamon in a large saucepan until melted, then add the apple and dates. Stir on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes, then add the cranberries, pistachios, oats, and coconut.

3. Transfer to the baking tin, smooth and press down well, and bake for 40 minutes.

4. Cool on a wire rack, and then cut into bars.
