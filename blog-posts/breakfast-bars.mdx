# Breakfast bars

<BlogTextWrapper>

This recipe is from Rukmini Iyer's The Roasting Tin. I make these when I'm going away overnight and I'm concerned that I might get hungry or that breakfast won't be organised. I swap out pistachios for almonds, as I'm not keen on pistachios.

### Ingredients

- 75g chopped dates
- 75g golden syrup (lys sirup in Denmark)
- 100g sugar
- 125g butter
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 75g dried cranberries

### Method

1. Cut some baking paper to fit up the sides of the tin. Crumble the paper into a ball, and then flatten it out again. Place it in the tin, ready for the mixture. Grate the apples and chop the dates. Preheat oven to 150Â°C fan.

2. Heat the golden syrup, sugar, butter, and cinnamon in a large saucepan until melted, then add the apple and dates. Stir on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes, then add the cranberries, slivered almonds, oats, and coconut.

3. Transfer to the baking tin, smooth and press down well, and bake for 40 minutes.

4. Leave them to cool completely in the tin. Do not touch them! Then pull them out by the paper and cut into bars. Store in an airtight container.
