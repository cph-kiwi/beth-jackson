# Steak tacos

This recipe is inspired from one by Rukmini Iyer in The Roasting Tin. However, I change it up a bit to work for me. My husband is obsessed with tacos, so we eat eat this as tacos rather than fajitas, as she suggests.

### Ingredients

- 2 sirloin steaks
- 1 red pepper
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red onion
- 2 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 3 tblsp olive oil
- salt and pepper
- chopped fresh coriander
- tacos
- crème fraîche
- limes cut into wedges
- grated cheddar cheese

### Method

1. Place the peppers, onion, spices, olive oil, salt and pepper in a large roasting tin. Preheat the grill to the highest setting.

2. Fry the steaks over a medium heat, in a pan on the stove top for 3 minutes each side. Wrap in some tin foil and put a tea towel over the top to keep them warm while they rest.

3. Put the roasting tin under the grill for 4 minutes, mix everything up and then return to the oven for a further 4 minutes.

4. Slice the steak thinly and mix it through the vegetables in the roasting tin, coating it in the spicy flavoured oil.

5. Serve with the coriander, crème fraîche, and cheese in tacos, with a spritz of lime juice from a wedge over the top.
