# Brookies

<BlogTextWrapper>

I saw these on Lily Pebbles' Instagram and was keen to give them a go. They look Christmassy, like they're covered in snow. So they make a nice gift. They're also dairy-free, in case you're looking for that. After they've been left to chill, the rolling and baking part takes me 1.5 hours.

### Ingredients

- 85g good quality cocoa powder
- 400g caster sugar
- 125ml vegetable oil
- 4 eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 250g plain flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 60g icing sugar

### Method

1. Sift the flour and baking powder and mix in the salt. Set aside.

2. In another bowl, sift the cocoa and mix together with the caster sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla. Beat in eggs one at a time. Stir the flour mixture into the cocoa mixture. Cover dough, and chill for at least 4 hours.

3. Preheat oven to 180Â°C (not fan-forced!). Line baking trays with parchment. Sift icing sugar onto a plate, spoon and roll mixture into 2.5cm balls coating each one with the icing sugar before placing onto prepared trays. Don't hold back really coating the balls with the sugar. Space them out well as they spread a lot while in the oven.

4. Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes. Let them stand on the baking tray for a minute before transferring to wire racks to cool.
