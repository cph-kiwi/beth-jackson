# Æblegrød

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is not a recipe. I'm stupid and can't remember anything. This is how I like to make æblegrød.

### Ingredients

- 1kg apples (around 10)
- 1 tblsp sugar
- 1 vanilla pod
- 2 dl water

### Method

1. Peel and core the apples. Cut them into smaller pieces.

2. Cut the vanilla pod in half and scrape out the seeds.

3. Place the apples, sugar, vanilla pod and seeds, and water in a saucepan.

4. Cook over a medium heat for around 30 mins, or until the apples have gone so soft that they have fallen to pieces and resemble sauce.

5. Remove the vanilla pod and blend the apples with a stick blender.

I let it cool and then measure out 1 cup (300g) portions into ziplock bags and freeze them.
