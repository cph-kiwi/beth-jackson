# French toast

<BlogTextWrapper>

I'm a bit time-poor at the moment, so I've been making this instead of pancakes in the weekends. The children like it, and it feels special. I make two thick slices for each person, and the ingredients listed are for two pieces of bread (one person/one serving).

### Method

1. Cut the bread into two thick slices.

2. Whisk together the egg, milk, cream, vanilla, and cinnamon.Lay the bread in a single layer in a shallow dish.

3. Pour the egg mixture over the bread. Allow to soak in for a couple of minutes. Flip the bread and ensure it is completely coated.

4. Heat a pan over a medium heat. Add the oil and butter. Cook the bread for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown.

5. Serve with maple syrup, jam, or your favourite toppings.
