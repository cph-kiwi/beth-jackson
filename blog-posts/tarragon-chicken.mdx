# Tarragon chicken

<BlogTextWrapper>

I'd wanted to try this for a while, before I finally made the effort. It turned out to be very little effort at all. I served it with roasted potatoes and grilled broccolini and mushrooms. I now make this when I want my family to feel like I've gone to some effort to make a fancy dinner.

- 60ml white wine
- 20g parmesan, grated

### Method

1. Slice chicken breasts through the centre to make 4 even sized breasts. Brush both sides of each piece with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

2. Add the butter and olive oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and fry both sides until golden, with the centre cooked right through. Remove and place to one side. Lower heat to medium.

3. Add the shallots to the pan and fry until they begin to soften/brown, then add garlic and fry for another minute. Pour in wine and scrape off any flavour stuck to the pan. Simmer until the wine reduces right down.

4. Pour in stock and cream, then add tarragon. Turn heat to low and gently simmer for 5 mins, or until the sauce starts to thicken slightly. Stir in parmesan then add salt & pepper to taste. Give it a final stir and simmer for another couple of minutes until the sauce thickens.

5. Add chicken back to the pan and coat in the sauce. Sprinkle over a pinch more tarragon then serve up with sides like roast potatoes.
