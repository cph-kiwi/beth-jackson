# Tomato soup

<BlogTextWrapper>

This is my own recipe, based on a few different recipes that I combined. I love the flavour from roasting the tomatoes before liquifying. Using rosemary instead of basil makes a nice change. This is best with a mixture of varieties of tomatoes. Some add sweetness, and some add a depth of flavour.

### Ingredients

- 1.5kg tomatoes
- 2 chopped onions
- 1/2 head of garlic, cloves peeled
- 2 sprigs of rosemary
- 60ml olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tsp red-wine vinegar
- 500ml vegetable stock

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 200°C.

2. Remove the stalks from the tomatoes and on the opposite side of the tomato, cut a small shallow X. This helps the skin come off easiy. Put them in a large heatproof bowl.

3. Pour hot water from a freshly boiled kettle over the tomatoes, and let them sit for two minutes. When you start to see the skins splitting, drain the water away. Peel the skins off.

4. Roughly chop the tomatoes, and place in a large roasting tin. If you are using cherry tomatoes, leave them whole. Add the onions and garlic.

5. Pull needles off the rosemary springs, and chop the leaves. Add to roasting tin.

6. Pour oil over, toss together. Add salt and pepper.

7. Roast for 40-50 mins, stirring occasionally.

8. Remove from the oven. Spoon into a large heatproof bowl. Add the vinegar and blend with a stick blender.

9. Put the purée into a large saucepan pan, and add the stock. Bring to a gentle simmer and reduce a little. Taste and adjust seasoning as required.

I have a kid, so we often serve this with a dollop of crème fraîche in hers (sour cream would taste better, but we can't get that in Denmark). However, it tastes better without the crème fraîche.
