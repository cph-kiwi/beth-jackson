# Koldskål ice cream

<BlogTextWrapper>

In Denmark, there are loads of artisan ice cream shops open in the summer. They often have less common flavours, but also the general quality is very high, all homemade etc. I really love koldskål, and koldskål ice cream has become my favourite, along with lakrids.
