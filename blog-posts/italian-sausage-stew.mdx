# Italian sausage stew

<BlogTextWrapper>

I started a new job in April! It's now November, and I'm finally starting to post here again ðŸ˜¬. My commute takes me past an Italian supermarket, so I was finally able to buy the ingredients required to try out this simple stew. It is VERY simple, meaning that the best quality ingredients are required. I didn't want to attempt this without using actual Italian sausages. It is very easy to throw together and then just takes a little time by itself on the stove top. I buy plain sausages because I cook for a tiny terrorist, but I think it would be smashing with the fennel or chilli varieties. Sometimes I use one can of butterbeans and one can of cannellini beans, just to mix it up.

### Ingredients

- 1 tblsp olive oil
- 4 Italian sausages
- 2 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 60 ml dry red vermouth (or red wine if you have a open bottle to hand)
- 2 x 400g cans butterbeans or cannellini beans, drained
- 1 x 290g jar char-grilled peppers, drained and chopped into strips
- 1 x 400g can cherry tomatoes in juice or chopped tomatoes
- 3 bay leaves

### Method

1. Put the oil in a large lidded pan over a medium heat and brown the sausages.

2. Crush the garlic and add to the sausage pan. Cook for 1 minute, then add the red vermouth. Let the vermouth bubble for a bit, to get the flavour off the bottom of the pan. Then add the beans, peppers and the can of tomatoes.

3. Half-fill the tomato can with water and add to the pan. Add the bay leaves, and salt and pepper to taste.

4. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Set the lid on and simmer for 15 minutes.

5. Remove the lid and simmer for as long as you can (from 5 minutes to 20 minutes) until the sauce is the thickness you want.

6. Fish out the sausages using tongs and place them on a chopping board. Slice them up, as this makes them go further. Return the sausage slices to the pan and stir well.

Serve with bread or toast.
