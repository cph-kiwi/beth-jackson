# Banana pancakes

<BlogTextWrapper>

I makes this when I have an over-ripe banana but I don't have enough to make banana bread. I also make these for my baby. We do baby-led so she needs food that is soft that she can hold herself.

### Ingredients

- 1 banana
- 2-3 tblsp flour
- 1 egg
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp vanilla paste
- pinch of cinnamon

### Method

1. Beat the egg. Mash the banana into the egg. Add the vanilla paste.

2. Sift the flour, cinnamon, baking powder and baking soda into the liquid. Stir to combine. Add more flour if the batter is too runny, but this is to your preference. Add 1/4 tsp salt if making for grownups but leave out for children.

3. Heat up a pancake pan, and cook as normal. I make little fritter-sized ones for the children.
